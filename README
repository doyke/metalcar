Kossel Metal Car Carriage


Im in the process of building a full metal Kossel 3d Printer. 
I've already fabbed metal corners, and want to do carriage and effector in metal. 
This is my current work in progress for the carriage. 
Its designed for 3 wheels from openbuilds, and a ecentric spacer for tension.
The car usings a iron cup and a rare earth magnet. 
The cup is threaded from the rear for a m3 screw. 
The upwards retangular is designed for mounting of a magnet, 
or with tape a flag for optical, or to push a switch.

Using a CNC to Create:
CNC Workflow:
    Create part in openscad - Finish with a projection, and export to svg
    open JScut in your web browser (http://jscut.org)
    Setup your tool sizes (I use a 1mm bit)
    Setup your PX to Inch to 26.74
    Setup how thick you want to cut (6mm for dibond for me)
    Select the object
    Generate a outside cut
    Save to ChilliPeppr via gdrive
    Switch to http://chilipeppr.com/tinyg
    Load the gcode using the jscut via gdrive
    Preview to make sure it looks right
    Start Cutting
