Kossel Metal Car Carriage


Im in the process of building a full metal Kossel 3d Printer. 
I've already fabbed metal corners, and want to do carriage and effector in metal. 
This is my current work in progress for the carriage. 
Its designed for 3 wheels from openbuilds, and a ecentric spacer for tension.
The car usings a iron cup and a rare earth magnet. 
The cup is threaded from the rear for a m3 screw. 
The upwards retangular is designed for mounting of a magnet, 
or with tape a flag for optical, or to push a switch.
